Got it 👍 You want a **professional README.md** for your Terraform project that explains:

* Technologies used
* Setup steps (init, plan, apply, destroy)
* Architecture steps (VPC → Subnets → Route Tables → IGW → EC2)
* License, acknowledgements

Here’s a clean, well-structured `README.md` draft for your project:

# Terraform AWS VPC + EC2 Deployment 🚀

This project provisions an **AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** with public and private subnets, route tables, an Internet Gateway, and an **EC2 instance** using **Terraform**.

---

## 📌 Technologies Used

* **Terraform** (Infrastructure as Code)
* **AWS EC2** (Elastic Compute Cloud)
* **AWS VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud)
* **AWS Subnets** (Public & Private)
* **AWS Route Tables**
* **AWS Internet Gateway**
* **AWS Security Groups**

## 🛠️ Steps Performed in Terraform

1. **Create a VPC** (`10.0.0.0/16`)
2. **Create two route tables**: one public, one private
3. **Create four subnets**:

   * 2 Public (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24)
   * 2 Private (10.0.3.0/24, 10.0.4.0/24)
4. **Associate subnets with route tables**:

   * Public subnets → Public Route Table
   * Private subnets → Private Route Table
5. **Create an Internet Gateway (IGW)**
6. **Attach the IGW to the VPC**
7. **Add a route in the Public Route Table** for `0.0.0.0/0` via IGW
8. **Create a Security Group** allowing:

   * SSH (22) from anywhere
   * HTTP (80) from anywhere
9. **Launch an EC2 instance** (`t2.micro`) in the public subnet with SSH + HTTP access

## ⚡ Terraform Commands

### 1️⃣ Initialize Terraform

```sh
terraform init
```

This downloads the AWS provider and prepares the working directory.

### 2️⃣ Validate the Configuration

```sh
terraform validate
```

Ensures the syntax and configuration are correct.

### 3️⃣ Preview the Execution Plan

```sh
terraform plan
```

Shows what resources will be created, changed, or destroyed.

### 4️⃣ Apply the Configuration

```sh
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Creates the AWS infrastructure.

### 5️⃣ Destroy Resources (Cleanup)

```sh
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

Tears down everything to avoid unnecessary costs.

## 🔑 Prerequisites

* An **AWS Account** with programmatic access
* **AWS CLI** configured (`aws configure`)
* Terraform installed → [Install Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
* An existing **Key Pair** in AWS named `tf-key` (used for SSH access to EC2)
